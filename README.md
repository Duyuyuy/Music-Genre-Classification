## Project Overview

In the purpose of helping entrepreneurs gain more knowledge about what they are going to do, this project will analyze an AirBnB service in Los Angeles - one of the most luxurious cities in the world to clarify how they can succeed here. The data would contain the neighborhood, location, price and reviews of accommodations that cooperate with AirBnB in Los Angeles.

By the end of this project, entrepreneurs will get the full insights of Los Angeles’s AirBnB service, including the distribution of accommodation along with the cost, the benefit and the ideal price for each type in order to achieve the best for their start-ups.
